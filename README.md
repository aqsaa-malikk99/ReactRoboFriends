# ReactRoboFriends

**ReactRoboFriends** is a learning project built using React. The application displays a list of robotic friends, allowing users to search through them and view detailed information about each robot.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Version 14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-robofriends.git
   cd react-robofriends
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Running Tests

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Building for Production

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Ejecting from Create React App

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
